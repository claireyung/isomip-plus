## Hackathon To-Do List

1. Discuss draft figures (see [Figure_outline.md](https://github.com/misomip/isomip-plus/blob/main/Figure_outline.md) ), identify any missing analyses
2. Check data - some assumptions were made when assigning the data paths e.g. versions. Please check [this list](https://github.com/misomip/isomip-plus/blob/main/notebooks/file-pointers/DataInformation.md). 
3. Model description for each model/group (including references), following MOM6 Example that Gustavo wrote. Potentially the same models submitted by different groups can have some common sections.
    1. COCO -> Kazuya Kusahara
    2. FVCOM -> Qin
    3. MITgcm-BAS - Yoshi
    4. MITgcm_BAS_Coupled - Yoshi
    5. MITgcm-JPL - Yoshi Nakayama (coordinate with Jim Jordan)
    6. MOM6-layer - done
    7. MOM6_SIGMA_ZSTAR - done
    8. MPAS-Ocean - Xylar
    9. NEMO-UKESM1is -> Robin + Nico
    10. NEMO-CNRS -> Robin + Nico
    11. POP2x - Xylar
    12. ROMS-UTAS - Mike Dinniman
4. Finalise figures e.g. checking code, dealing with NaNs, proper time periods of averaging, use of subplots. There are some notebooks with draft versions of the figures, plus Xylar's code in the `general-plotting` folder (if the notebook you desire doesn't exist please make a new one!).

    15. [focus on boundary layer cross section (y axis = distance from ice rather than ocean depth) -> can see temperature structure (to 5m grid resolution)](https://github.com/misomip/isomip-plus/issues/17) -> Dave Gwyther
    16. [Thermal/haline/u* in supplementary](https://github.com/misomip/isomip-plus/issues/18) -> Xylar Asay-Davis
    17. Shifted time axis spaghetti plots -> Claire
    18. hysteresis?
    19. vertical profiles of T and S (different x positions, each corner of + sign) temp vs distance from ice (rather than depth) -> Claire
  
        *Submit plots and code back to main by pull request by 30 June. Beginning of July writing hackathon!*
6. Write descriptions about each of the figures on Overleaf for the results section, especially figures that won't qualitatively change
7. Discuss the results, give feedback
8. Someone to write the Introduction? -> Ben
