# Figure outline
Not finalised! To be determined later.
- Experimental design (ice draft, bathymetry, side profile of temperature and salinity)
- Ocean0 temperature structure to show different sized plumes/mixing?
- Melt rate spatial distribution for Ocean0 (all experiments)
- Tuning parameters $\Gamma_T$ , $\Gamma_S$ for each model in a table or bar chart
- Warming area-averaged ocean melt rates and overturning stream function as a function of time, showing timescales for the change (line plots)
- Warming end state overturning and barotropic streamfunctions (all experiments?)
- Cooling area-averaged ocean melt rates and streamfunction strength (line plots, like in the warming)
- Cooling end state overturning and barotropic streamfunctions (all experiments?)
- Scaling between melt and circulation strength for warming and cooling? Scatter plots where each data point is one time
- Thermal or haline driving at ice front vs melt rate - quadratic scaling?
- Melt rate feedbacks - thermal/haline driving and friction velocity beneath ice shelf and contribution to melt rate
- A figure to show variation of models with their “typ” values/usage
