# ISOMIP+ Collaborative Analysis and Writing Project

Ten different modelling groups submitted results to the ISOMIP+ model intercomparison project, using the [Asay-Davis et al. (2016) protocol](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/2471/2016/). In this collaborative repository, we have generated analysis figures to compare the models. The associated study "Results of the second Ice Shelfâ€“Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (ISOMIP+)" is in preparation.
